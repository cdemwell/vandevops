\#vandevops
======

The #vandevops channel on freenode, created for the community of Vancouver (BC) area operations and devops professionals. We welcome your participation! Find us via your favourite IRC client, or you can use this [web IRC client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23vandevops&uio=d4) provided by Freenode: [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23vandevops&uio=d4](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23vandevops&uio=d4).

\#vandevops is a semi-professional space for conversation and mutual support. Come and talk about what's going on for you professionally, or ask about what others are doing. It's a place where people can learn about the local scene, talk about technologies and practices, or just connect with the community of people who care about the same challenges and solutions that you do.

Ops, Devolopment and Devops are hard jobs, but they're founded on a basis of empathy and compassion for your colleagues. As such, you should know that #vandevops is a safe space and your participation here is subject to our [code of conduct](codeofconduct.md). You should act in a way that is positive for the community and supportive of your colleagues in the field. If in doubt, ask.

Many people use #vandevops as a space to ask questions of others, which we definitely encourage. Before asking questions, please review our [FAQ](faq.md) to see if someone has already asked. If your question hasn't been asked, we'll do our best to answer - but if it is of general interest, you will be expected to submit a pull request to add the answer to the [FAQ](faq.md). If you don't know that, we'll assume you haven't read the [FAQ](faq.md)!
