\#vanops Code of Conduct
========================


#What we're here for



The Vancouver operations/devops community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make our community better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with people inside and outside the community. #vanops is founded on the idea that a strong community benefits everyone. To that end, please consider as a guideline that you should always try to benefit the community by encouraging participation, open-mindedness, learning, and safety in every interaction. This applies equally to founders, mentors, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

More than just a guideline, all participants in our channel are required to agree with and abide by the following code of conduct. Channel moderators will enforce this code at all times. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

> tl;dr: Don’t be a Jerk, work to make things better

#Need Help?

Contact one of the channel operators. Our policy is not to lurk with our badges on, but you can /msg cdemwell (twitter: @cdemwell), attractiveape, or laurent.

#The Quick Version

\#vanops is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of channel participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context or at any time, including in public channel, in private messages, or via any other messaging or social media network. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the channel at the discretion of the community organisers.

#The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexualised commentary, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately - although we hope it won't come to that point.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the channel temporarily or permanently.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns that you do not wish to address on your own, please contact a channel operator immediately. Channel operators as of this writing are cdemwell, attractiveape, and laurent.

Channel operators will be happy to help participants through direct intervention, contacting local law enforcement, or by otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your active participation in the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all times, on and offline, with everyone involved in the channel. Harassment of our colleagues outside of #vanops will not be simply ignored.

#Recruiters, Sales, and other Promoters

\#vanops is for community members both new and old. You are not welcome to merely recruit in the channel. We consider anyone who joins and immediately starts to try to recruit staff to be contravening this rule. Come and get to know us, and then you can tell us about positions that may interest members.

Similarly, #vanops is not a venue for advertising or sales. We're sure your product is amazing, but this is not the place for it.
